# Problem 1
### Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

### Introduction
Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics, describing the motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone, after being projected with an initial velocity. One of the key characteristics of projectile motion is the range, which depends on the angle of projection. This investigation aims to analyze how the range varies as a function of the launch angle.

### Theory
The motion of a projectile launched from ground level can be analyzed using the equations of kinematics. The horizontal and vertical components of motion are given by:

- *Horizontal motion:*
  $$
  x = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t
  $$
- *Vertical motion:*
  $$
  y = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
  $$

where:
- \( x \) and \( y \) are the horizontal and vertical displacements, respectively,
- \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity,
- \( \theta \) is the angle of projection,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/sÂ²), and
- \( t \) is the time of flight.

The time of flight \( T \) can be found by setting \( y = 0 \):
  $$
  T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
  $$

The range \( R \) of the projectile is given by:
  $$
  R = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot T
  $$
Substituting \( T \):
  $$
  R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
  $$
This equation shows that the range is maximized when \( \sin(2\theta) \) is maximized, which occurs at \( 2\theta = 90^\circ \), or \( \theta = 45^\circ \).
