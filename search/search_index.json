Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion describes the motion of an object thrown into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. Assumptions: - No air resistance - Flat ground (launch and landing at the same height) - Constant gravitational acceleration g The equations of motion are: - Horizontal motion: x(t) = v0 * cos(\u03b8) * t - Vertical motion: y(t) = v0 * sin(\u03b8) * t - (1/2) * g * t^2 At the time of landing, y(t) = 0 . Solving for time of flight T : The horizontal range R is: Key Takeaways: R depends on the sine of twice the projection angle 2\u03b8 Maximum range occurs at \u03b8 = 45\u00b0 (when sin(2\u03b8) = 1) 2.
